# Leonardo Lima: CAB User

  
![Expected screen output](https://github.com/zeonardo/combination-user/blob/master/src/assets/combination-user.png)


## Demo

* [deployed combination-user](https://zeonardo.github.io/combination-user)

  

## Required Tasks
  
1. ✅ Develop a React application that fetches and displays data from https://randomuser.me/api/
2. ✅ The following 4 values should be displayed: the user’s first and last name, image and country
3. ✅ Also add a button to show and hide the data. When show is clicked a new different user is loaded

### Bonus Tasks

1. ✅ Both the functionality, code quality and styling are going to be evaluated and discussed in a follow-up interview
2. ✅ We work with TypeScript, but accept solutions in both TypeScript and JavaScript (and even ReScript)
3. ✅ Automated tests are optional
4. ✅ The source code may be delivered as a zip-file, or simply a GitHub, CodeSandbox (or similar) repository


### Extra Miles

- Basic [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) with "tab key" and keyboard navigation
- Basic styling with styled-components library
- Basic responsivity for smaller devices
- Nearly perfect Google Lighthouse score (96+ performance, 100 in accessibility, best practices and SEO)
- [Live demo](https://zeonardo.github.io/combination-user)


### Assumptions

- The show/hide button could be improved into a toggle switch

## Available Scripts


In the project directory, you can run:

  

### `yarn start` or `npm start` (*yarn preferred*)

  

Runs the app in development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes to the code.

You may also see any lint errors in the console.

 

### `yarn test` or `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

  

### `yarn build` or `npm run build`

Builds the app for production into the `build` folder.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
